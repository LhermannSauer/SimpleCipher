# SimpleCipher
A simple cipher program that allows the used to cipher and decipher a message via a number of methods used throughout history.
Currently working on Caesar Cipher, ROT13, Alberti Cipher and Vigenere Cipher.

<ul>
<li>Caesar Cipher: one of the most know ciphers, in which each letter of the message is shifted a number of positions in the alphabet.</li>
<li>ROT13: A simple cipher that shifts the position of each letter 13 positions in the alphabet, so they can easily be decrypted by shifting 13 positions again.</li>
<li>Vigenere Cipher: a polyalphabet cipher in which a message is encrypted by using a keyword. Each letter of the message will be shift, considering that the letter A will take the position of a letter of the keyword, in succession. </li>
<li>Alberti Cipher: A polyalphabetic cipher that uses two concentric disks, one uppercase and one lowercase. The sender and recipient will have a key (single character) that will be the letter in the lowercase circle that will be moved to match a random uppercase letter, and each letter will be shifted accordingly. Uppercase letter can be used as much as it is desired, being only lowercase characters the one that carry meaning. The order of the lowercase circle is not the same as the uppercase one. By default, the lowercase circle will be "zxvtrpnljhfdbacegikmoqsuwy" </li>

</ul>
